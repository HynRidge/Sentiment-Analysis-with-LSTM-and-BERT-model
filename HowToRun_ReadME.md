To run the experiments we used for the LSTM-based models:
0. The .ipynb files are optimized to be run on Google Colab.
1. Download the MAMS-ATSA data from https://github.com/siat-nlp/MAMS-for-ABSA under data/ folder, or the MAMS-ATSA folder in this repo.
2. Download the glove.42B.300d.txt from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/.
3. Place the two (MAMS-ATSA folder and glove.42B.300d.txt) downloaded data under the same folder as the .ipynb files.
4. If this is the first time running the notebook, uncomment this line: <br>
\# process_data() <br>
under the Pipeline section.
5. Run all.

To run BERT.ipynb:
0. The .ipynb files are optimized to be run on Google Colab.
1. Download the MAMS-ATSA data from https://github.com/siat-nlp/MAMS-for-ABSA under data/ folder, or the MAMS-ATSA folder in this repo.
2. Place the MAMS-ATSA folder downloaded data under the same folder as the BERT.ipynb file.
3. Run all.
