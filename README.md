# CS4248-Team13 Code Submission
This repo contains all the codes we used for all the experiments that Team 13 runs for CS4248 Team Project submission.

To run the model notebooks, please refer to **HowToRun_ReadME.md** for the instructions on how to run the notebooks.

The models and results we found are compiled in our paper, entitled **"Aspect-Term Sentiment Analysis on Multi Aspect Multi Sentiment (MAMS)
Dataset Using Variations of LSTM and BERT-based Models"**.
