# CS4248-Team13 Code Submission
This repo contains all the codes we used for all the experiments that Team 13 runs for CS4248 Team Project submission.

To run the LSTM-based models (AE-LSTM.ipynb and ATAE-LSTM.ipynb), please refer to **LSTM_Models_ReadME.md** for the instructions on how to run the notebooks.

To run the BERT-based models (BERT.ipynb, BERT-SPC.ipynb, and BERT-CapsNET.ipynb), please refer to **BERT_Models_ReadME.md** for the instructions on how to run the notebooks. 

The models and results we found are compiled in our paper, entitled **"Aspect-Term Sentiment Analysis on Multi Aspect Multi Sentiment (MAMS)
Dataset Using Variations of LSTM and BERT-based Models"**.
