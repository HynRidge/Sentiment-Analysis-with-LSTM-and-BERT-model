# About the Project
This project aims to experiment Aspect-Term Sentiment Analysis using variations of BERT and LSTM and analyze in depth why BERT variations are far more superior than any LSTM variations.

# About the Dataset
The dataset that is used in this experiment are [MAMS dataset]( https://github.com/siat-nlp/MAMS-for-ABSA).
